// Modules and Variables
// Sass code that doesn't cause Sass to actually output CSS.
// Things like mixin declarations, functions, and variables.
// base gets all these utility modules
@import "scss-modules/base";

// Partials- the actual code. each file here will do a single
// import base to get access to my entire Sass environment
// (ie. the variables and the modules)
@import "components/sticky-layout/sticky-layout";
@import "components/seller/seller";
@import "components/progress-bar/progress-bar";
@import "components/navbar/navbar";
// @import "components/sticky-footer/sticky-footer";
@import "scss-modules/typography";

// Third-party stuff not to be modified
// eg: bootstrap? which just acts on its own dom stuff
// and doesn't need to be imported in your scss
